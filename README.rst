What
====

I'm exploring world of compilers and interpreters.

This is a simple concurrent virtual machine. It can run many internal threads in few real OS threads.

Python is chosen as fast prototyping language.


What i've learned
=================

- Yay! Virtual machines work! :)
- It is stupid easy to create a stupid virtual machine
- Shared-state threads aren't bad or ugly while you only read from other virtual threads.
- Problem #1: scheduling virtual threads execution. This may be done in numerous different ways.

  Assign a single virtual thread to single real executor (OS thread, CPU, etc) is probably the simplest, but definately not the best option.

  Then, choosing how much instructions to execute before yielding control to another virtual thread is another problem.

  Executing at most N instructions is probably simplest, but obviously not the best solution.

  *Note*: The problem of scheduling instructions is a bit wider because sometimes
  some parts of code inside single virtual thread may be paralleled as well (implicit micro threads, instruction level parallelism).
  But i haven't got into that yet.

- Problem #2: sleeping and resuming virtual threads. Waiting for other virtual threads to finish. More generally, event system.

  Clearly, virtual machine needs some kind of event system, at least to react on outside world events. Interrupts in x86 computers is an example of such event system.

  My effort in doing event system for vm-001 drown in locks. Need a good design on thread-safe multi-producer, multi-consumer event dispatcher.


VM specification
================

This is a register based virtual machine. Thus, it has registers for storing values. Values are signed integer numbers.

There are 8 (without a reason) thread-local registers named r0, r1, ... r7.
And 8 global registers named g0, g1, ... g7.


Instructions:

`copy D S`
    copies value of thread-local register S to thread-local register D. Same as assembler instruction `mov`.
`gcopy D S`
    copies value of register S to register D. Any or both registers may be global.

    Copying from or to global register is special because it locks register for concurrent reading/writing.

`set R val`
    sets thread-local register R to some constant value, which may be a constant expression, like '3 + 5'.
`gset R val`
    sets global register R to some constant value.

`swap R1 R2`
    swaps values of two thread-local registers.

`eval D op R1 R2`
    puts result of evaluation `R1 op R2` into register D. All registers must be thread-local.

    See operators below.

`jump R`
    unconditionally jumps to instruction pointed by thread-local register R.
`jz A E`
    jumps to instruction A if register E is equal to zero.

    A may be a constant address or thread-local register. E must be thread-local register.
`jnz A E`
    same as `jz`, but tests for `E != 0`.
`addr R`
    puts current instruction address to thread-local register R.

`spawn D A`
    spawns new thread with starting instruction A. A may be a constant address or thread-local register.

    New thread's registers are copied from its parent.
    Puts id of new thread into register D.
`spawna D A`
    same as `spawn`, but VM deletes new thread when it does `tstop`.
    Name 'spawna' means SPAWN Automatically deleted thread.
`tself D`
    puts id of current thread into register D.
`tget D T S`
    inter-thread `copy` of register S in thread T into register D in current thread.
`twait T`
    stops current thread, until thread T is not stopped. When thread T does `tstop`, current thread resumes execution.
`tstop`
    stops current thread.
    Do this in main thread to gracefully shutdown VM.
`tdel T`
    deletes thread T. After this instruction, `tget _ T _` and `twait T` will crash VM.

`print R`
    prints the value in thread-local register R.

Operators:

math:
  -, +, \*, /. Math operators evaluate to integer number.

  `/` is integer division. Division by zero crashes the VM. Division is rounded towards zero.

logic:
  <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=. Logic operators evaluate to 1 for true and 0 for false.


Sample
======

This sample program prints GCD (greatest common denominator) of two integers supplied in g0 and g1.

    gcopy r0 g0
    gcopy r1 g1

    :start
    jz :done r1        # if b == 0, we're done

    eval r2 < r0 r1    # a < b?
    jz :sub r2         # continue if not
    swap r0 r1         # swap a and b if yes

    :sub
    eval r0 - r0 r1    # a = a - b
    jump :start

    :done
    print r0


This sample program concurrently calculates fib(x) of integer supplied in g0.

    jump :start

    :F-fib             # F- for "function" fib(x), x is r0
    eval r1 < r0 2     # x < 2?
    jnz :F-fib-done r1 # return x if yes

    eval r1 - r0 1     # a = x - 1
    eval r2 - r0 2     # b = x - 2

    copy r0 r1
    spawn r3 :F-fib    # spawn fib(a)
    copy r0 r2
    spawn r4 :F-fib    # spawn fib(b)

    twait r3
    tget r1 r3 r0      # a = wait for result of fib(a)
    tdel r3            # delete thread to avoid memory leaks
    twait r4
    tget r2 r4 r0      # b = wait for result of fib(b)
    tdel r4            # delete thread to avoid memory leaks

    eval r0 + r1 r2    # x = a + b

    :F-fib-done
    tstop

    :start
    gcopy r0 g0
    spawn r1 :F-fib
    twait r1
    tget r0 r1 r0
    print r0
    # not deleting thread because VM stops anyway
